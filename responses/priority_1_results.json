It quickly became one of the most popular restaurants in downtown Toronto, attracting many celebrities and dignitaries. These are the rewards of my failures and setbacks! My goal is to become a successful entrepreneur! My extensive international experience and diverse culinary background contributed greatly to the success of my Toronto restaurant.
