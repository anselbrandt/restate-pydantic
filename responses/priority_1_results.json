    "content": "Gary Hayes\nOwner, Retail Adventure Inc.\nPointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada\n500 connections, 18052 followers\n\n\nAbout\nWith a rich background in Canadian retailing, I have been at the forefront of innovative concepts that have left a lasting mark on the industry. One of my notable achievements was pioneering the BAYMART discount store concept at The Bay, long before the advent of Walmart in Canada. The success of BAYMART led to an expanded role, where I steered The Bay's foray into apparel, positioning it as a fashion leader in the 70's. Transitioning from department stores to specialty retail, I took on roles of increasing responsibility at Reitman's. As Vice President of Smart Set, and later as VP of Reitman's in the 80's, I introduced the groundbreaking in-season \"item\" repeat concept, a strategy that anticipated the \"fast fashion\" approach adopted by industry giants like Forever 21, H&M, and Zara. My journey then led me to Giant Tiger, where I devised and executed a robust fashion apparel strategy, fortifying GT against the challenges posed by Walmart. The events I orchestrated, including the PJ Party, Breast Cancer, Get Fit, Garden Party, and Canada Day celebrations, commanded a dominant presence in the market. I leverage my extensive experience in department stores, specialty retail, and discount stores to navigate the dynamic landscape of digital marketing. I know what has to be done on social media. My focus lies in evaluating retail strategies and uncovering emerging opportunities, all of which are meticulously documented in my weekly reports. THE REPORT: At the heart of my work is a weekly senior management report, meticulously crafted to unveil potential opportunities and highlight potential pitfalls. Armed with unfiltered information, this report empowers decision-makers to pose the right questions and allocate resources strategically to address the most pressing challenges.\n\n\nExperience\nOwner\n[Retail Adventure Inc.](N/A)  \nJun 1999 - Present\nMontreal, Quebec, Canada\n\n\n\nEducation\nUniversity of Oregon\nBachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.), Marketing/Marketing Management, General\n1959 - 1963\nActivities and Societies: foreign students scholarship for academic excellence.",
