My strengths aside from a depth of culinary experience are with people, giving them the knowlege and tools to succeed. I've made a legacy in my career of all the great people who have worked with me and who have gone on to create amazing success for themselves in their own careers. Specialties: NOtaBLE ~ The Restaurant is a full service restaurant which opened in August of 2010. The style of cuisine is \"Gourmet Comfort\", everything is made in our open kitchen which features a large wood and charcoal burning rotisserie on which you will find succulent aromatic rubbed chickens and a roast feature on every day.\n\n\nExperience\nChef/Proprietor\n[The Nash Restaurant & Off Cut Bar](N/A)  \nNov 2014 - Present\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada\nMy legacy project, combining everything that I've learned in 35+ years in the restaurant industry.This beauty is housed in the former National Hotel, which was opened in July of 1907. The former hotel sat empty for a number of years until I joined forces with interior designer Sarah Ward of Sarah Ward Interiors to create this beautiful room which honours the many decades of history in the neighbourhood of Inglewood. The restaurant consists of the light, airy main dining room which faces into the open kitchen and rotisserie bar and which does a modern take on comforting and satisfying dishes, served in a crisp yet friendly way. The restaurant space includes Off Cut Bar - the somewhat badass, sexy, sultry and yet extremely welcoming area which serves contemporary and classic cocktails along with craft beers, great wines and a menu featuring all secondary cuts of meat, poultry and seafood.One hundred and fifty seats in all, including interesting seating areas and tables made from recovered Canadian prairie barn wood and featuring two community tables situated directly beside the kitchen.\n\n\nEducation\nVancouver Community College\nCCFCC Red Seal, Culinary\n1979 - 1980\nNone",
